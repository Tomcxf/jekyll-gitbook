<h2>software installed by conda </h2>
First, you should find the environment.yml, which cover most of software and dependencies installed by conda.
Moreover, you can replace ```mamba``` to ```conda``` to speed up.
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

After installing from conda, you can run 
``` shell
conda activate FdR
```
to active relative environment.

By the way, you can specify the name of environment by editing the first line of environment.yml

<h2>software installed by pip </h2>
Based from my experience, we suggest you to install nanocompore through pip, just type 

```shell
pip install nanocompore
```

<h2>software installed through binary file</h2>

There're still three software need to install in binary file.

- [a branch of nanopolish suitable for slow5](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish/files/9256504/nanopolish.tar.gz)

- [f5c](https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c/releases/download/v1.1/f5c-v1.1-binaries.tar.gz)

For f5c, we need to run
```shell
bash /f5c/script/install-vbz.sh to solve vbz error for fast5
```
and add PATH followed by the output of script.

After extract, don't forget to add their PATH to .bashrc, just type ```vim ~/.bashrc``` then add following codes

```shell
export PATH="location of your software:$PATH"
```
Type source ~/.bashrc to finish

Finally, for the reason that copyright protection, we can't supply Guppy directly. Searcher should download Guppy in Nanopore Comm
