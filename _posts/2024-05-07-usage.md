To run pipeline successfully, two files are necessary.

One is .py file which includes analysis steps, while config file which allocate necessary files. Both of them can be found in /script/

There're two types of config files which called `configForMainTail.yaml` and `configForModifAS.yaml`.

First is used for dRNAmain and dRNAtail, while other is for dRNAmodif_1/_2 and dRNAas.py.

You needn't to worry since the location of yaml has been assigned in .py files.

We also offer examples of config files in /examples/

```shell
 snakemake -s {dRNAmain.py / dRNAtail.py / dRNAmodif.py / dRNAas.py}
           -s the snakemake file you want to run
           --cores / -c : the number of cores to use (necessary)
           --set-threads myrule=XXX set threads XXX for running
```

Snakemake offer a test module, you can process dry-run to test whether there're any error.

```shell
snakemake -s {dRNAmain.py / dRNAtail.py / dRNAmodif.py / dRNAas.py} -n
```


> ##### TIP
>
> If pipeline broken by some error, just type command again after you fix it.
> snakemake will automatically continue from the broken point.
