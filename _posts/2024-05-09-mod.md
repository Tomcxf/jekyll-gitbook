First, we need to be clear that dRNAmodif consist of two parts - dRNAmodif_1 and dRNAmodif_2.
If you want to process this analysis, you should apply dRNAmodif_1 to all samples first.
Then, run dRNAmodif_2 to find out possential modification based on comparsion.
That's why dRNAmodif_1 use the same yaml as dRNAmain/dRNAtail.
